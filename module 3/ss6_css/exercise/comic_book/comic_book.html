                Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris
                and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941).[1] Initially a backup
                feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series.
                The character is a pastiche of the iconic Marvel Comics character Namor. During the late 1950s and 1960s
                superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League.
                In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with storylines
                depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.[2] Aquaman's villains include his archenemy
                Black Manta and his own half-brother Ocean Master, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely
                recognized in popular culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his
                wholesome, weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples
                of comedy programs and stand-up routines,[3][4][5] leading DC at several times to attempt to make the
                character edgier or more powerful in the comic books.[6] Modern comic book depictions have attempted
                to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman
                as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose
                beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.[7]

                Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations, first appearing in animated form in the 1967
                The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program. Since then
                he has appeared in various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s series
                Justice League and Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, as well as several
                DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor Alan Ritchson also portrayed the character in the live
                action television show Smallville. In the DC Extended Universe, actor Jason Momoa portrays the
                character in the films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League and its director's cut
                Zack Snyder's Justice League, Aquaman, the HBO Max series Peacemaker, and the upcoming Aquaman
                and the Lost Kingdom.

                Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris
                and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941).[1] Initially a backup
                feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series.
                The character is a pastiche of the iconic Marvel Comics character Namor. During the late 1950s and 1960s
                superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League.
                In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with storylines
                depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.[2] Aquaman's villains include his archenemy
                Black Manta and his own half-brother Ocean Master, among others.

                The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely
                recognized in popular culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his
                wholesome, weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples
                of comedy programs and stand-up routines,[3][4][5] leading DC at several times to attempt to make the
                character edgier or more powerful in the comic books.[6] Modern comic book depictions have attempted
                to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman
                as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose
                beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.[7]

                Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations, first appearing in animated form in the 1967
                The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program. Since then
                he has appeared in various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s series
                Justice League and Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, as well as several
